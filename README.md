Project Description
The objective of this project is to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can accurately classify brain MRI images into two classes: tumorous and non-tumorous. The model is trained on a dataset of augmented brain MRI images to improve generalization and robustness.

Dataset
The dataset consists of brain MRI images obtained from various sources. It is split into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate model training and evaluation. The images are preprocessed and augmented using techniques like rotation, shearing, flipping, and normalization to enhance model performance.

Model Architecture
The neural network architecture used for this project is a sequential CNN model. It comprises convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers for feature extraction and downsampling. The final layers include dense (fully connected) layers with dropout for classification.

Training
The model is trained using the TensorFlow/Keras framework. During training, the training data is fed into the model in batches, and the model learns to minimize the binary cross-entropy loss. Training progress and metrics (accuracy, loss) are monitored to assess model performance.

Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated on a separate test set to measure its performance on unseen data. Evaluation metrics include accuracy and loss, which provide insights into the model's effectiveness in classifying brain tumor images.

Results
The results section summarizes the performance of the trained model on the test set. It includes metrics such as accuracy, loss, and any additional insights gained from analyzing model predictions.
