## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of accurately distinguishing between brain tumor and non-tumor images from MRI scans. This README provides an overview of the project's components, including dataset details, model architecture, training methodology, and evaluation metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of MRI images obtained from various sources. It includes two main categories:
- Tumorous (brain tumor present)
- Non-tumorous (healthy brain)

The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets for model development and evaluation.

## Data Preprocessing

### Augmentation

Data augmentation techniques are applied to increase the diversity of the training dataset, enhancing the model's robustness. Techniques such as rotation, horizontal and vertical flips, and zoom are utilized to generate additional training samples.

### Normalization

Image data is normalized to ensure consistent scaling across all samples. This typically involves rescaling pixel values to the range [0, 1].

## Model Architecture

The model architecture is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are well-suited for image classification tasks. The architecture includes multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers to extract relevant features from the input images.

## Training

The model is trained using the augmented dataset. Training involves optimizing the model parameters using the Adam optimizer and monitoring performance metrics such as accuracy and loss.

## Evaluation

### Validation

During training, model performance is evaluated on a validation set to assess generalization and prevent overfitting. Validation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed.

### Testing

After training, the model is evaluated on a separate test set to measure its performance on unseen data. Test metrics provide insights into the model's real-world effectiveness.

## Results

The results section summarizes the model's performance metrics obtained from training, validation, and testing. It includes visualizations such as accuracy curves, confusion matrices, and sample predictions.
